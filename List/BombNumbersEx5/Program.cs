            //to detonate every occurrence of the special bomb number and according to its power -his neighbors from left and
            //right.Detonations are performed from left to right and all detonated numbers disappear. Finally print the sum of
            //the remaining elements in the sequence.
            //Examples
            //Input Output Comments
            //1 2 2 4 2 2 2 9
            //4 2

            //12 Special number is 4 with power 2.After detontaion we are left with the
            //sequence[1, 2, 9] with sum 12.

            //1 4 4 2 8 9 1
            //9 3

            //5 Special number is 9 with power 3.After detontaion we are left with the
            //sequence[1, 4] with sum 5.Since the 9 has only 1 neighbour from the
            //right we remove just it(one number instead of 3).

            //1 7 7 1 2 3
            //7 1

            //6 Detonations are performed from left to right.We cannot detonate the
            //second occurance of 7, because its already destroyed by the first
            //occurance.The numbers[1, 2, 3] survive.Their sum is 6.

            //1 1 2 1 1 1 2 1 1 1
            //2 1

            //4 The red and yellow numbers disappear in two sequential detonations.
            //The result is the sequence [1, 1, 1, 1]. Sum = 4.
